\repsec{Date}
March 18\textsuperscript{th} -- 19\textsuperscript{th} 2023

\repsec{Place}
London (Twickenham), United Kingdom

\repsec{Website or other source(s) of information}
All information on the website of Mahjong Twickenham: registration, agenda, list of participants, venue, recommendations for commuting, and hotels nearby.
The website was regularly updated with new participants.
However, the player list was poorly formatted and a little hard to read.

\repsec{Participants} 64 players:
\begin{itemize}
    \item United Kingdom: 31
    \item Poland: 11
    \item Not specified: 9
    \item France: 5
    \item Spain: 2
    \item Sweden: 1
    \item Switzerland: 1
    \item Netherlands: 1
    \item Italy: 1
    \item Ireland: 1
    \item Germany: 1
\end{itemize}

\repsec{Playing schedule}
2 days, 7 rounds (4+3) of 75 minutes.

\repsec{Location}
The Richmond Bridge Club, Cambridge Park, Twickenham, TW1 2PG, United Kingdom.
The venue is large enough to host 64 players with enough space between them, the outside has nice views and the place is very quiet.
It would be nice to have some signs outside that would lead to where the tournament was taking place.

Trophies for individual ranking (1\textsuperscript{st}, 2\textsuperscript{nd} and 3\textsuperscript{rd}).

\repsec{Other comments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It would be nice to have a full agenda on the reverse side of the player's badge.
    \item The organizers didn't wait for all the players to build the wall before starting a hanchan.
        However, I reported the issue and it was addressed in later games.
\end{itemize}

\repsec{Conclusion}
A well-organised tournament in Twickenham, good venue and a wonderful atmosphere.
All information was clearly provided.
Overall, this event is a success.
